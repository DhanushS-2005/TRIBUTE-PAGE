Despite being a Tata, he had to prove his capabilities in a competitive environment. In 1971, he was appointed the director-in-charge of the National Radio and Electronics Company Limited (NELCO), a subsidiary of the Tata Group that was in dire financial trouble. Although his efforts to turn the company around were not entirely successful, his tenacity and willingness to take risks did not go unnoticed.</p>

            <p><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-right"></i>In addition to expanding globally, Ratan Tata was instrumental in the group’s foray into new industries such as information technology, telecom, and automobiles. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the group’s IT services arm, became one of the largest and most valuable IT services companies in the world. Similarly, Tata Motors, under his leadership, launched the Tata Indica, the first car to be fully designed and manufactured in India, and later the Tata Nano, an affordable car that aimed to make personal transportation accessible to millions of Indians.</p>
